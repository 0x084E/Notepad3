--------------------------------------------------
Version 2 Build 505 (23 September 2017)
--------------------------------------------------
+ 1st chunk of StrSafe migration.
+ Some more StrSafe changes
+ Fix: manually edited settings (SciDirectWriteTech, SciFontQuality) 
  should be placed in settings section [Settings2].
+ Extended default "space char set" for "Accelerated Word Navigation" to avoid 
  unexpected "accelerated word navigation" behavior, space-char extension is 
  restricted to 7-bit ASCII char set (ignoring specified non-7-bit-ASCII chars).
+ StrSafe adaptions
+ Fixed: settings SciFontQuality have been overwritten by Scheme configuration.
  (Fonts: Calibri, Cambria, Candara, Consolas, Constantia, Corbel, Segoe UI are using 
  'cleartype smoothing' (SC_EFF_QUALITY_LCD_OPTIMIZED) by default, if not 
  configured in Schema definition for Lexer)
+ Added font "Source Code Pro" to list of special fonts for cleartype smoothing.
+ Fix: undo destructive operation on selection (rectangle) does not restore 
  selection or preserves selection mode (extends selection on caret movement)
  -> need to send SCI_CANCEL at the end of restored selection.
+ Found bug caused by StrSafe migration 
  (COUNTOF() for buffer size must not be used on buffer pointer)
+ migrate StrCpyN() and StrCatBuff() to corresponding StrSafe.h methods
+ Adapted lstrcpyn() calls according to StrSafe.h requirements.
+ Refactoring of "Accelerated Word Navigation" to be compliant with Scintillas 
  WhiteSpace and Punctuation defines.
+ "Accelerated Word Navigation" activation influences "Mark Occurrences" (whole word) if set
+ Extended: Remember selection undo / redo
+ Added undo / redo selection to more operations
+ Found Scintilla 400 method "SCI_CUT" (cut selection) broken: lost last char
  replaced by SCI_COPY & SCI_CLEAR combination (for now).
+ changes to EditGetClipboardText() solved the SCI_CUT problem, so it can be 
  switched back from SCI_COPY & SCI_CLEAR to SCI_CUT 
  (byte alignment in 64-bit, i am nut sure)
+ switching Scintilla internal codepage to UTF-8 only (resp. Japanese, 
  Chinese and Korean DBCS) single-byte encoding is supported externally and 
  converted (fore and back) to UTF-8 internally, this simplifies 
  i.e. clipboard exchange, etc.
+ Removed support for obsolete Korean Johab (1361) codepage.
+ Fixed ConvertText() according to internal SCI codepage
+ Refactoring: Encoding handling
+ More operations for selections undo/redo.
+ Enabled "unlimited" (as in Scintilla Lib: dep. on memory and INT_MAX) 
  undo / redo selection history using utarray from uthash header library 
  (https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/index.html)
+ Moved crypto readme to doc dir
+ remove internal codepage support for Chinese, Japan, Korean DBCS use 
  generalized UTF-8 codepage instead 
  (conversions do not work as expected within scintilla lib)
- Dropping Windows XP support , using compiler toolset vc141 Win SDK 10.0. 
  (current VC++ redistributable needed?)
+ Replaced lstrcmp() and lstrcmpi() by StrSafe (helper.h defined) methods.
+ Relaunch elevated keeping current changes in a buffer.
+ Fixed some problems for feature "relaunch elevated preserve changes".
+ First AppVeyor config
+ Remember window position in case of "relaunch elevated".
+ Fixed memory initialization problem during InitInstance()
+ Enhanced consistency between toolbar (save button) and titlebar (modified marker)
+ "Relaunch elevated": use current .ini-file instead of new user's (Admin's) .ini
+ Cleanup tmp filebuffer, if elevation has been rejected.
+ Fixed crash in case of wrong Encoding (detection)
+ Changed version display on Help/About.
+ New Powershell script to patch version numbers
+ appveyor.yml using same powershell commands to patch version
- Remove FindReplaceDlg handle declared as external from compilation unit 
  Edit.c - not really needed here. (externals (handles / pointers) seemed to 
  be a problem on module init instance time in 64-bit)
+ Fixed: Open find dialog the first time (new NP3 instance) while
  clipboard is empty, NP3 crashes (try to LocalFree() static allocated memory)
+ Fixed: RegExpr "Find previous" corrected (find mode "left to right" has been 
  used, which has not the intended behavior).
+ Updated Compiler Info.
+ Added build.txt (and .ps1 changes) for Local Build Version patching 
  (common AppVeyor/Local script).
+ Fixed issue "Convert to Title Case" while selected text is all upper case.
+ Fixed broken "Complete Word" feature (Ctrl+Enter/Return).
+ Changed accelerator key for feature "Complete Word" from Ctrl+Enter to Ctrl+Alt+Enter.
+ Added feature "Insert New (empty) Line above current line Ctrl+Enter (as in VisualStudio).
+ Code cleanup
+ Added new Settings "Virtual Space on Rectangular Selection" used to select. 
  rectangle not delimited by line endings (but including virtual space).
+ Readme.txt Updated. (Thanks Will)
