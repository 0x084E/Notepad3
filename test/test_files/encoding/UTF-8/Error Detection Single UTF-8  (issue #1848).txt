Apache on Windows:
==================


* Which distribution?

apache.org no longer provides Windows binaries. They direct you to other sources.

Candidates:
  - The Apache Haus (apachehaus.com)
  - Apache Lounge   (apachelounge.com)

My current favourite is Apache Lounge. Use the distro with the highest Visual C version you can, and that matches the target system architecture.

Prerequisite: Visual C++ Redistributable


* Updating:

(Also check for the latest Visual C++ Redistributable)

Pr√©cis:

- Build a new folder at same level as production folder, with "_new" suffix
- Copy as much production data as possible to new folder
- Stop (old) production
- Copy remainder of production data to new folder, moving what can't be copied because of space constraints
- Rename production folder to backup folder (becomes backup)
- Rename new folder to production folder (becomes production)
- Start (new) production and test
